### in brief this small project about a simple profile applying some of concepts of React.js and also i used Charka UI.

-Overall, this code creates a custom hook called `useScrollDirection` that determines the direction of scrolling on the page by setting up a listener for the `scroll` event on the window object. The hook returns the current scroll direction as its output and also i explained it in detial.

1. `const useScrollDirection = () => {` - This line defines a custom hook called `useScrollDirection`.
2. `const [scrollDirection, setScrollDirection] = useState(null)` - This line uses the `useState` hook to initialize the `scrollDirection` state variable to `null`.
3. `useEffect(() => {` - This line uses the `useEffect` hook to set up a listener for the `scroll` event on the window object.
4. `let lastScrollY = window.pageYOffset` - This line initializes a variable called `lastScrollY` to the current vertical scroll position of the window.
5. `const  updateScrollDirection = () => {` - This line defines a function called `updateScrollDirection` that will be called whenever the `scroll` event is triggered.
6. `const scrollY = window.pageYOffset` - This line gets the current vertical scroll position of the window.
7. `const direction = scrollY > lastScrollY ? 'down' : 'up'` - This line determines whether the user is scrolling up or down by comparing the current scroll position to the previous one.
8. I also added a call to `Math.abs()` to ensure that `scrollDifference` is always a positive value.
   Overall, it should make the code more efficient and accurate.
9. `if(direction !== scrollDirection && (scrollY - lastScrollY > 10 || scrollY - lastScrollY < -10)){` - This line checks whether the scroll direction has changed and whether the user has scrolled more than 10 pixels since the last update.
10. `setScrollDirection(direction)` - This line updates the `scrollDirection` state variable with the new direction value.
11. `lastScrollY = scrollY > 0 ? scrollY : 0` - This line updates the `lastScrollY` variable to the current scroll position, but sets it to 0 if the user has scrolled to the top of the page.
12. `window.addEventListener('scroll', updateScrollDirection)` - This line adds the `updateScrollDirection` function as a listener for the `scroll` event on the window object.
13. `},[scrollDirection])` - This line specifies that the `useEffect` hook should only run when the `scrollDirection` state variable changes.
14. `return scrollDirection` - This line returns the `scrollDirection` state variable from the hook.

// React.useEffect(() => {
// if (response) {
// onOpen(response.type, response.message);
// if (response.type === 'success') {
// Formik.resetForm();
// }
// }
// },[response]);

# ContactMeSection.js

i used the Chakra UI library for styling and Formik for form management.

i used importing several components from the Chakra UI library, which will be used to build the form.

import \* as Yup from 'yup'
This line imports the Yup library, which is used to define the form validation schema.

import {Form, Formik,Field} from 'formik'
This line imports the Formik library, which is a form management library for React.

import useSubmit from "../Hook/useSubmit"; and import {useAlertContext} from "../context/alertContext";
These two lines import custom hooks used in the code for submission and displaying alerts.

# useSumbit.js

-This is a custom hook that can be used to submit a form and simulate an API call
It uses Math.random() to simulate a random success or failure, with 50% chance of each -`const wait = (ms) => new Promise((resolve) => setTimeout(resolve, ms));`
This line declares a function wait that returns a Promise that will resolve after a specified number of milliseconds.
-isLoading is a state variable that keeps track of whether a submission is currently being processed. It is initially set to false using the useState hook.

response is a state variable that stores the result of the submission (if successful) or an error message (if there was an error). It is initially set to null using the useState hook.

submit is a function that takes in a URL and some values, and makes an API request to submit the values to the server. The function uses the wait function to simulate a delay of 2 seconds before resolving the Promise. If random is less than 0.5, an error is thrown and the catch block sets the response to an error message. Otherwise, the setResponse function is used to update the response state variable with a success message.

Finally, the useSubmit hook returns an object with the isLoading, response, and submit properties.
